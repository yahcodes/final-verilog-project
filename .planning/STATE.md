## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: distance = p1_pos + p2_pos (avoids global coordinate overlap; makes distance 0 reachable)
- [Init]: action codes 0=Kick, 1=Punch, 2=MoveLeft, 3=MoveRight, 4=Wait (aligns shop items 0-4 with move types)
- [Init]: no separate END state; health=0 jumps immediately to SHOP
- [Init]: move inventory resets to 0 on round restart (no carryover)

### Pending Todos
